### Fullstack Test
###### Demonstration of Development Concepts for Interview
***

### Description
This repository was my submission for the fourth round of interviews for a Fullstack Web Developer position. Applicants were given 3 days to complete a small app that interfaces with the Spotify REST API using PHP, JavaScript, and any frameworks deemed necessary. The entire set of guidelines are listed in the [FullstackTest.pdf](https://github.com/Sranderley/FullstackTest/blob/master/FullstackTest.pdf).

The app can be viewed in an environment with PHP 5.4.x or later installed. To launch the application, follow the instructions listed in [README.txt](https://github.com/Sranderley/FullstackTest/blob/master/README.txt).
