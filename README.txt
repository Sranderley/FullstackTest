Thank you so much for the opportunity to work on the Fullstack Test!

Starting the server:
	Windows:
		Double click on the file titled 'launch_server_win'
	Unix:
		Double click on the file titled 'launch_server_unix'
	Command Line:
		Type 'php -S localhost:8080' in a command line environment
		with PHP installed and press return

After starting the server, open firefox or chrome and enter,

	'localhost:8080/root/'

into the address bar. The trailing '/' is important! You can now navigate the site.

Thanks again!
